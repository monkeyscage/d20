# d20


In Dungeons&Dragons Table version we use papers to store the informations of a player.

In Ethereum we use a Smart Contract. This leads to a serie of implications, on which I try to shape a possible version of D20 for Ethereum.

Due to the high gas costs, you will see in this description the complexity of such system and you will end up with the idea that the right way is to have some kind of off-chain transactions for implementing complex quests.

Anyway in Ethereum a player can be much more than a paper storage, since we have variables and methods, and since we can remove the authority and ideally I can play with you without the need of a Master: my warrior (a contract) can attack your warrior (another contract) in total autonomy, and by means of a certified trustless fight. It would be like an old style play, where we just play throwing the dice and there is no off-chain virtual world to see on the screen.

All this research is to explore this option. Assuming we can build such system, it will be relatively easy to create off-chain quests, and register the new stats (experience etc. etc.) in your player contract only once and at the end of the quest, resulting in affordable gas costs.

Keep in mind that I didn't still face the problem of randomness. It is a big problem, but is still secondary in this "research".
